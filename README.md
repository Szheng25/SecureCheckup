Project Title: Secure Checkup  
@authors: Tahiba Rahman, Aparnaa Senthilnathan, Stacey Zheng  
A Hack.COMS 2024 Hackathon Project  

## Inspiration
We wanted to tackle the challenge of healthcare data disproportionately underrepresenting minority groups.

## What it does
Our website uses healthcare data and formats it in a way that specifically compares underrepresented groups so the user is able to visually see if the data is skewed. 

## How we built it
- Frontend uses HTML/CSS and JavaScript
- Backend uses a database in PLSQL on Oracle. Visualizing data statistics using Tableau for business operations efficiency
- Front and backend are combined using REST API in JSON using Python

## Challenges we ran into
- The main difficulty was not being able to find a way to connect to a server on Tableau, which would have allowed us to directly connect to the database on Oracle. Instead, the data is exported into an excel spreadsheet from Oracle and uploaded to Tableau. 
- There was also difficulty in working with JavaScript to get the navigation bar to be responsive on the website but it was able to later be implemented. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Combining our ideas of using a database and allowing users to interact with it on a website to create an impact.
- Implementing a database using Oracle and visualizing that data in Tableau, which are both tools currently widely used in the business industry to display data on billing and patient information.
- Getting the data analysis automated using an API so that the process can be streamlined.

## What we learned
- Our team faced had not worked with Tableau before and while we couldn't get data directly from Oracle, we were able to find a workaround with converting the data into a spreadsheet.
- Getting a project idea fleshed out and implemented within the time period given for this hackathon was also a challenge. 
- Adding data protection using Oracle.

## What's next for SecureCheckup
Being able to implement security features such as validating and sanitizing the user's input on the website would help make sure all the patient and medical information is protected on the database.
